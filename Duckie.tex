\chapter*{Introduction}     
\section*{Why Write this Book}

\paragraph*{} Mathematics is an essential aspect of human life. There is a stereotype of people disliking and struggling with mathematics, which I believe is simply because we are, at a young age, often told to try to compute, rather than being challenged with fundamental questions of how to understand the world around us. 
\section*{How to use this book}
\paragraph*{} Learning and understanding mathematics takes more than reading this book purely for its story, but wrestling with new ideas and questions, and attempting to resolve those questions through reasoning. To this end, after reading the story on each page, have students attempt to develop an answer using their intuition and prior knowledge to build toward the correct answer. Only after they have worked towards the right answer without hints and engaged in discussion, read the solution.
\paragraph{} Even beyond the scope of the book, encourage them to ask questions about the world around them. Reason through math in games they know and love, in stories, and in everyday life and present unintuitive problems which they can use the tools from this book and otherwise to solve in genuine scenarios.

%Introduce the story
\paragraph{} All was quiet in the goose village. It was a sort of place where parent geese could look out and feel their goslings were safe. But one fall evening, there was a sense of despair in the village. All the geese knew that migration was coming, and that they would have to embark on a dangerous journey. 
\paragraph{} "Enough is enough." Duckie thought. But what could he do? The goose authorities, the leaders of the village, had controlled migrations for as long as anyone in the village could remember. They had kept everyone safe, but every year the journey had been getting harder.
\paragraph{} Growing up in the goose village, Duckie had heard the stories of the fabled "golden goose" of legend who lived on the highest mountain. According to the legend, the golden goose would bring safety and peace to the village. That peace would in turn lead to an upheaval, and would save the village from great tyranny. Many geese had tried to seek her, but it was a dangerous journey, and none had ever returned. 
\paragraph{} The goose authorities had tried to stop geese from leaving. They claimed it was for their own protection, but with the more difficult migrations, they had taken their power too far. Duckie and the others who believed in the golden goose knew - they were afraid that they would lose their power.
\paragraph{} "No. I have no choice." 
\paragraph{} Duckie decided then and there, that he would try to find the golden goose, and would help create the great change to society the hero was meant to bring. Hopefully then, he could save all the geese. He would have to break the goose authority's rules and search for the hero.
