%Introduce the story
\paragraph{} All was quiet in the goose village. The autumn breeze scented the air within the forest. The sun shone brightly, casting light onto the main path. To an outsider looking at the village, it would have seemed idyllic. Undoubtedly, it was the sort of place where parent geese could look out and feel their goslings were safe. At any other time, it would have been a pleasant evening - a tranquil picture of peace. Yet that fall evening, there was a sense of despair in the village. Each goose knew that their quiet evenings would soon be over, and that they would have to leave for migration. 
\paragraph{} "Enough is enough." Duckie thought. For as long as he could remember, he had been afraid of the long and dangerous journey. Between the icy mountain peaks and vast exposing stretches of forest, the journey left him and the other geese vulnerable to the unwelcome dangers of the wilderness. It was no wonder as to why fewer geese returned every year. Duckie looked up the main road at city hall, where the goose authorities stood watching the city. 
\paragraph{} Created to protect the village from danger, the goose authorities created and enforced the rules village. To ensure the the citizens followed their rules, they created the elite corps of goose police. In the past years, the goose authorities had begun to abuse their power. They had closed down the schools, burned the village's books, and closed off the village from the outside world. But what could Duckie do? The goose authorities, the leaders of the village, had controlled migrations for as long as anyone in the village could remember, and he would soon have to embark on the dangerous journey.
\paragraph{} Duckie thought back to his childhood. 
\paragraph{} When Duckie was young, he loved stories. He would spend hours at the library reading stories of the great heroes of the village. Duckie especially loved tales of the golden goose of legend, who lived on the highest mountain's peak. 
\paragraph{} Duckie reached into his pocket and looked at a charred page. It was all that remained of the library. A scrap of stained paper with an inscription, smeared with years of use. It read 
\paragraph{$\ldots$}
\paragraph{} Duckie knew what he needed to do.
\paragraph{} Many geese had tried to seek the Golden Goose, but it was a dangerous journey, and none had ever returned. 
\paragraph{} "No. I have no choice." 
\paragraph{} "Remember the legend Duckie. Remember the golden goose."

Duckie and Gus get to the top of the mountain
and see that there is no one there
there are some golden feathers scattered
but it doesn't seem like anyone has been there in a long time
duckie and gus are ultimately dissapointed
after all, they came all this way
so they turn around, and look from the top of the mountain
from their great height, they can barely make out the village in the distance
and they come to the realization that
they made it all this way
made so many friends
in making the effort to find the golden goose
they had created a reliable system for they themselves to provide safe passage
The math they learned along the way
as duckie looked out the mouth of the cave, his feathers began to shimmer, and in the evening light, they almost seemed golden
