\section*{Why Write this Book}

\paragraph*{} Mathematics is an essential aspect of human life. There is a stereotype of people disliking and struggling with mathematics, which I believe is simply because we are, at a young age, often told to try to compute, rather than being challenged with fundamental questions of how to understand the world around us. 
\section*{How to use this book}
\paragraph*{} Learning and understanding mathematics takes more than reading this book purely for its story, but wrestling with new ideas and questions, and attempting to resolve those questions through reasoning. To this end, after reading the story on each page, have students attempt to develop an answer using their intuition and prior knowledge to build toward the correct answer. Only after they have worked towards the right answer without hints and engaged in discussion, read the solution.
\paragraph{} Even beyond the scope of the book, encourage them to ask questions about the world around them. Reason through math in games they know and love, in stories, and in everyday life and present unintuitive problems which they can use the tools from this book and otherwise to solve in genuine scenarios.

%Introduce the story
\paragraph{} All was quiet in the goose village. It was a sort of place where parent geese could look out and feel their goslings were safe. But one fall evening, there was a sense of despair in the village. All the geese knew that migration was coming, and that they would have to embark on a dangerous journey. Every year, the buildings got taller, there were more and more people along the way, and there were more and more predators. 
\paragraph{} "Enough is enough." Duckie thought. But what could he do? The goose authorities, the leaders of the village, had controlled migrations for as long as anyone in the village could remember. They had kept everyone safe, but every year it had been getting harder.
\paragraph{} There were of course the stories of the fabled "golden goose" of legend who lived on the highest mountain, who would save all goose kind, but as far as anyone knew, those were only myth.  
\paragraph{} "No. I have no choice." 
\paragraph{} Duckie decided then and there, that he would try to find the golden goose, and would help create the great change to society the hero was meant to bring. Hopefully then, he could save all the geese. He would have to break the goose authority's rules and search for the hero.
