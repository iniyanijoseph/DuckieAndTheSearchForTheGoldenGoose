%\chapter*{Introduction}     
%\section*{Why Write this Book}

%\paragraph*{} Mathematics is an essential aspect of human life. There is a stereotype of people disliking and struggling with mathematics, which I believe is simply because we are, at a young age, often told to try to compute, rather than being challenged with fundamental questions of how to understand the world around us. 
%\section*{How to use this book}
%\paragraph*{} Learning and understanding mathematics takes more than reading this book purely for its story, but wrestling with new ideas and questions, and attempting to resolve those questions through reasoning. To this end, after reading the story on each page, have students attempt to develop an answer using their intuition and prior knowledge to build toward the correct answer. Only after they have worked towards the right answer without hints and engaged in discussion, read the solution.
%\paragraph{} Even beyond the scope of the book, encourage them to ask questions about the world around them. Reason through math in games they know and love, in stories, and in everyday life and present unintuitive problems which they can use the tools from this book and otherwise to solve in genuine scenarios.

%Introduce the story
\paragraph{} All was quiet in the goose village. It was a sort of place where parent geese could look out and feel their goslings were safe. But one fall evening, there was a sense of despair in the village. All the geese knew that migration was coming, and that they would have to embark on a dangerous journey. 
\paragraph{} "Enough is enough." Duckie thought. But what could he do? The goose authorities, the leaders of the village, had controlled migrations for as long as anyone in the village could remember. 
\paragraph{} Created to protect the village from danger, they ruled the village and made decisions for the village. To ensure the others followed their rules, they created the elite corps of goose police. This system had worked for some time, but in the past years, they had abused their power. They had closed down the schools, burned the village's books, and stopped all geese from leaving the village.
\paragraph{} Growing up, Duckie had heard the stories of the fabled "golden goose" of legend who lived on the highest mountain. According to the stories, the golden goose would bring great change to the village. That change would in turn lead to great change, and would save the village from tyranny, and lead to an era of peace. Many geese had tried to seek her, but it was a dangerous journey, and none had ever returned. 
\paragraph{} "No. I have no choice." 
\paragraph{} Duckie decided then and there, that he would try to find the golden goose, and would help create the great change to society the hero was meant to bring. Hopefully then, he could save all the geese. He would have to break the goose authority's rules and search for the hero.
