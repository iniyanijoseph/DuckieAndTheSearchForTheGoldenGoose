Gus the Goose went out to play

Out with friends on a sunny day

Who were they? You may try to ask?

This *set* of friends with whom Gus basked?

Duckie, Cottontail, and Blues McGee

He began to count them!

1, 2, 3

He ended with the cardinality!

#footnote(The number of elements in a set is the cardinality)

Tomorrow new friends came to play

And some friends had to go away

This gave a new set

2, 3, 4

Looks like Gus has friends galore!

Yesterday, we called friends "A"

Today Gus plays with friends called "J"

What happens if we join them together?

The *union* of these friends forever?

We get set "K" with all of them!

{1, 2, 3, 4}

What if we took the friends from both?

The *intersection* of these days that goeth?

We get {2, 3} as you can see!

Its got "2" cardinality

Just be careful about the count for union, 

The sum of both may be more than bargained!

#footnote($#abs(A) + #abs(B) - #abs(A intersection B)$)
