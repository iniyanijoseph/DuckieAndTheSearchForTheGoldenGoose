Gus the Goose went out to play
Out with friends on a sunny day

Who were they? You may try to ask?
This *set* of friends with whom Gus basked?

Duckie, Cottontail, and Blues McGee
He began to count them: 1, 2, 3
He ended with the cardinality!

Tomorrow new friends came to play
And some friends had to go away

This gave a new set: 2, 3, 4
Looks like Gus has friends galore!

Yesterday, we called friends "A"
Today Gus plays with friends called "J"

What happens if we join them together?
The *union* of these friends forever?

We get set "K" with all of them!
{1, 2, 3, 4}

What if we took the friends from both?
The *intersection* of these days that goeth?

We get {2, 3} as you can see!
Its got "2" cardinality

Just be careful about the count for union, 
The sum of both may be more than bargained!

Phew! Now that was quite a bit of work
Now lets go have a bit of mirth

Cottontail thought of a game to play
Dodgeball would make it an excellent day!

Lets make teams, made of set G
Each one a *subset* for games, you see

Now how to think about who hit who?
Consider some pairs of goose to goose

{Pairs}

This *relation* between them shows us the game
Who hit who and who stayed the same

A relation like this is also a set
The *Cartesian product* is the biggest one yet

After the question, losing team had their doubts
When did each person get out? 

They made a relation of each person and times
To find if each person had gone behind. 

Each person could only have been outed once
So there is only one pair (player, time) for each player and dunce

Plus at the end, every player was outed
This *function* took inputs and then outputted

The time that each goose got knocked out
And they could see without a doubt

That they had lost and Gus had won
But that's ok, they had lots of fun!

= Break

Gus was happy
He had had a great day

He wanted to go home 
but couldn't find a way

He needed to get from house to house
But he wanted to travel, as quick as a mouse

He had a list of all the streets
A relation on all the places to eat!

This graph he drew as quickly as he could
Drawing a tangle of walkways called edges

How could he get from house A to house Z?
Which of the paths to travel should he?

Once he made it back home he had an idea
How could he connect all the houses together,?

He didn't want to have to become absentee
The new acyclic graph he called it a tree!

Gus was exhausted
He went off to sleep

He dreamt of soft sheep
Without making a peep

When he woke up, refreshed
He wondered "hmm see"

I know all these meanings,
But don't have feelings

Because how can I reason about 
Graphs, sets, and trees?

I can argue directly 
"A leads to B"

But it may not be easy if it cannot be

What if I went through another direction?
I start with the opposite and find a contradiction?

That means that the opposite cannot be true
So the statement is done. Yay and woohoo!
