\chapter{Essential Algebra}
\paragraph{} Duckie and G{\"u}s's various competitions made the goose authorities a bit confused. Because of Duckie and G{\"u}s's competitions, they had lost track of Duckie's location. They decided that they needed to review their records, and try to figure out where their activities fifth day had landed them.

%Equality
\subchapter{Equality}
{Duckie and G{\"u}s had tied in each of competitions. Because of this, their positions were always the same.}
{G{\"u}s's position = Duckie's position. Duckie's distance from the village was $\distanceNineOpFi~km$, so G{\"u}s's position was also $\distanceNineOpFi~km$.}
{When two things are the same, we write this in mathematics as "=", or "equals".}

\subchapter{The Equality Rule}
{The goose authorities, knew G{\"u}s was a fast flier. His training as a policegoose had made him a fearsome foe. While Duckie and G{\"u}s were traveled together, they realized that every time G{\"u}s flew ahead of Duckie, Duckie had to increase his position by the same amount to keep up.}
{Duckie's position + $\Delta$ position = G{\"u}s's position + $\Delta$ position.\newline
	$\distanceNineOpFi~km + \distanceThreeTwoDelta~km = \distanceThreeTwo~km$ 
	\footnote{$\Delta$ means "change in"}}
{What happens to one side of an equation must happen to the other side so that they are still the same.}

\subchapter{Variables}
{The goose authorities were still a bit confused about Duckie and G{\"u}s's progress. They knew that the two had $\numSectionsTw$ competitions, and that Duckie and G{\"u}s began competing when they were $\distanceNineOpFi~km$ away from the village. They also knew that Duckie and G{\"u}s stopped competing at $\distanceThreeTwo~km$. How much did they travel on average in each competition?}
{\begin{center}$\numSectionsTw x + \distanceNineOpFi = \distanceThreeTwo \linebreak \numSectionsTw x + \distanceNineOpFi - \distanceNineOpFi = \distanceThreeTwo - \distanceNineOpFi \linebreak \numSectionsTw x = \distanceThreeThI \linebreak \frac{ \numSectionsTw x}{\numSectionsTw} = \frac{\distanceThreeThI}{\numSectionsTw} \linebreak x = \distanceThreeTh  $\end{center}}
{A letters or symbol can be used to represent a number which isnâ€™t already known, such as "$x$". $\numSectionsTw x + \distanceNineOpFi = \distanceThreeTwo$ means that $\numSectionsTw\ast$(some number)$ + \distanceNineOpFi = \distanceThreeTwo$.}
