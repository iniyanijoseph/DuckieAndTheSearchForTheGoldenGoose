\chapter{Polynomials}
\paragraph{} The next morning, Duckie and G{\"u}s looked out of their campground. 
\paragraph{} "Looks like we are almost there. I've been talking to Maggie and I think she wants to come with us to find the Golden Goose" G{\"u}s remarked.
\paragraph{} "That's great!" Duckie said. "We shouldn't count our geese before they hatch though. Even though we are almost there, we are going to start the most difficult part of the journey. Look at the mountain!"
\paragraph{} The looked at the mountain and saw it towering above them. 
\paragraph{} "I agree. I think we need to prepare."
\paragraph{} As the rest of the geese woke up, Duckie and G{\"u}s stood up and announced their departure. 
\paragraph{} "Hello everyone. Thank you for your hospitality. I want to make sure we can get there quickly so that we can save our village, so we need to travel fast. We need to continue on our journey. Would anyone like to come with us?"
\paragraph{} Maggie stepped forward. "I'll join!"
\paragraph{} "Great!" Duckie said.

\subchapter{Polynomial Functions}
{\paragraph{} Duckie, Maggie, and G{\"u}s began flying towards the mountain. 
\paragraph{} "Wow thats pretty steep. We should probably try to figure out where it is and what it looks like." Maggie noted. 
\paragraph{} Gus had been thinking about this "What if we make it a function? The input can be the horizontal position, and the output can be its height, h."
\paragraph{} "That makes sense" Duckie said. "Looking at the mountain, it looks to me like it touches the ground at x=-? and x=?, and its got two points, one at h(x)=? and h(x)=?" 
\paragraph{} What is h(x)?}

{A polynomial function is a function where f(x) is the sum of terms, such that each term is a constant multiplied with x raised to a natural number. In other words, $\sum a*x^{k}$ s.t. $a \in \mathbb{R}, k \in \mathbb{N}$}
