They get to the base of the mountain \\ 
They bein climbing, and notice it is getting steeper. They have climbed $\delta y$ amounts vertically, and $\delta x $ amount horizontally. \\ 
What is average rate of change \\
They want to know about slope at each point. They can make it more accurate by having less $\delta x$. They shrink the x until it is infinitesimalyl small, and are able to get the slope.\\ 
Can make another function for this mountain which has the value of the slope at every point? Look at a simple case and work the way up \\
They are getting tired, and must rest. They also need to know where the golden goose is. \\
\indent They find the max and min of this function.
