= Act 1

- Ordinary World
  - Arithmetic, understanding maps from the books
  - We open on a quiet scene: a village, obscured from the rest of the world by a dense forest.
  - This story is like many others - a hero, unassuming yet bold in his own right - but to understand this hero, we must zoom a little closer.
  - Enter Gus. Gus the Goose. For this village is not a typical village of humans, but a village of geese.
    - They exist all over the place if you look for them
    - Ever wonder where the geese go in between migrations? Where they lay their nests?
    - This is one such village
  - In most ways Gus is quite a normal young gosling
  - He spends his mornings at school, and comes to the library. He sits there for hours, until night, reading.

  - Many books he forgets
    - They are not important to him.
    - Gus is a little different from the other goslings - because he craves knowledge

    - But all creatures great and small, goose or otherwise, there is a book
      - A book which illuminates, and endures
    - One special day, Gus went to the library.
      - And he saw it, beaten up, and on the highest shelves.
      - It was unusual. Most of the books were bound with glossy bright covers, whose yellow pages glowed warmly and invitingly
      - This book seemed almost to say "go away". It was unimpressive. Its yellow was not the yellow of the sun, but of unwash, of filth
      - Gus was fascinated immediately
    - He walked towards it
      - "Atlas of Legends" it read on the spine
      - Gus, tiptoeing as far has he could, reached for the book, almost knocking off some of the more precariously placed books on the lower shelves
    - Gus closed his eyes and began to skim the book
      - Most of it was illegible - Years of abuse and neglect had faded the ink
      - Others were not written in any language Gus could understand
      - In fact, he could really only make out one
        - Gus sat down on the large angled lecturn in the corner of the library.
        - He flicked on the light
          - "The Golden Goose" it said brightly
          - Gus had heard the name - everyone had in the village
          - It was the legend of the prophicized savior of geese, the hero of the migration
        - Gus began to study the map

      - A previous owner of the book had marked the location of the village, so Gus was able to begin.
        - There were several landmarks on the map
        - They all seemed frightening and dangerous
      - Gus followed the path from the map to the mountain where the golden goose lived.
      - The first destination was the dark river, x km from the village.
        - The emblem on the map was a smudgy, inky blue.
        - It was vast, and there was no way to pass around it other than going directly through
      - The second was the shady forest, x km from the river.
      - How far was it from the village?

      - Gus looked at the map again.
        - He realized there was another landmark x km closer to the village between the forest and the river. How far from the village was it?
      - The route to the to eat x calories for ever x kilometers
        -
      - As Gus motioned to close up the book, the pages began to fall out.
      - The librarian knew Gus well.
        - The had known him for years and knew he wouldn't damage the books intentionally, and so let him go free.
        - She gathered up the remaining pages and put the book back.

- The Call - Books are burned
    - Since that day, many years have passed. Much has changed in the village.
    - It is no longer the happy-go-lucky village of Gus's youth
      - It has dulled - The Goosemayor has totally changed the village.
      - Last week, a horrible incident occurred.
      - The library was burned.
        - Gus walked down the morning after the fire.
        - The Goosemayor and the fire department had deemed it an accident - a broken lamp
          - But Gus was not so convinced
          - They called everything an accident
        - As Gus walked by the library, he saw a glint in the light.
          - all that was found was an old, rusted badge - The badge of a Goosepolice.
          - Gus knew the Goosemayor had orchestrated the incident.
            - The books took away power from his regime

- Refusal - Gus does not want to risk the journey to find the golden goose
  - Gus traveled down the road to the librarian.
  - As he approached the house, she was silently weeping, sitting on the porch .
    - "The books!" she said softly as Gus walked up the porch.
    - She looked down. All that remained from the library was a yellowed page that had fallen out from a book many years ago.
    - Gus kneeled in front of her. The wind wailed through the gaps in the porch, drowning out the sounds from the outside world.
    - Gus asekd "How are you feeling?"
    - She smiled and coughed slightly "I've seen better days"
    - "I don't know what to do. I wish the golden goose was here to save us from the Goosemayor."
    - She looked up at him slowly
    - Gus looked up from the floor "What happened?"
    - "Why can't you seek the golden goose?"
    - Gus was amused.
